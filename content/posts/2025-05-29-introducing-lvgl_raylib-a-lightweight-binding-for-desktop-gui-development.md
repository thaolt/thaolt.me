I'm excited to share my latest open-source project: [`lvgl_raylib`](https://github.com/thaolt/lvgl_raylib), a lightweight binding library that seamlessly integrates [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). This project aims to simplify desktop application development by combining the strengths of these two powerful libraries.

## Why Combine LVGL and raylib?

Both LVGL and raylib are renowned in their respective domains:

* **LVGL** (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) is a popular open-source embedded graphics library designed to create beautiful UIs for any MCU, MPU, and display type. It offers over 30 built-in widgets, a powerful style system, and supports various languages.&#x20;

* **raylib** is a simple and easy-to-use library for game and graphical application development. Written in C99, it provides a straightforward API for handling graphics, audio, and input, making it ideal for prototyping and educational purposes.&#x20;

By combining these two, `lvgl_raylib` allows developers to leverage LVGL's rich UI capabilities within the flexible and lightweight environment provided by raylib, making it easier to develop desktop applications with embedded-style interfaces.

## Key Features

* **Lightweight Integration**: `lvgl_raylib` offers a minimalistic binding that connects LVGL's rendering system with raylib's display capabilities, ensuring efficient performance.

* **Cross-Platform Support**: Thanks to raylib's cross-platform nature, applications built with `lvgl_raylib` can run on various desktop operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

* **Ease of Use**: The library is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing developers to set up and start building applications quickly without dealing with complex configurations.

## Getting Started

To begin using `lvgl_raylib`, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thaolt/lvgl_raylib.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and follow the instructions provided in the README to set up your development environment and build your first application.

## Example Application

An example application, `todo_app`, is included in the repository to demonstrate the capabilities of `lvgl_raylib`. It showcases how to create a simple to-do list application with a graphical interface using LVGL widgets rendered through raylib.
